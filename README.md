# meal_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is my second project for learning flutter navigations and multiple screens.
This Meal_app gives you a variety of dishes splitted into categories.
It will give you the ingredients and recipe of a particular dish according to which category you select.
It also have a filter section in which you can filter out some dishes according to your preference and also
have a Favorite button to store some dishes in a different page for a user friendly experience.
